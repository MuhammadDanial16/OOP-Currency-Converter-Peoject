OOP-Currency-Converter-Project:

Objectives: 
The primary objectives of this Currency Converter project are: 

 Implement 100% Object-Oriented Programming in C++ using all major  
OOP concepts. 
 
 Allow user account creation with dynamic object allocation and  
constructor overloading.  
 
 Convert major global currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) to PKR using   
inheritance and virtual functions. 
 
 Enable the addition of new currencies at runtime using dynamic memory  
and class instantiation. 
 
 Overload operators (such as + and =) for currency operations and  
logging. 
 
 Ensure proper memory management by using new for creation and delete  
for cleanup. 
 
 Build a user-friendly menu interface to handle all functionalities and use  
graphics to display a bar chart showing the most converted currencies.
